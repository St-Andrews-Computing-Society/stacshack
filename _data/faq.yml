# FAQ, optional.
# Questions, answers, and an optional 'id' field for hyperlinks (e.g. if you need to show a specific answer to someone).
# The last question is automatically added with the contact information.
# Beware, YAML/Markdown syntax is a bit tricky:
# - Use the weird |- syntax to allow answers to span lines.
# - End lines with two spaces if you want to force a line break, otherwise the line break is ignored.

- q: What is StacsHack?
  a: |- 
        StacsHack is the annual student hackathon hosted by the St Andrews Unversity Computing
        Society, where over 150 people gather each year to build something new. This event will

        StacsHack will be entirely virtual this year, in line with University and Scottish
        Government guidelines. We'll be hosting the event on Discord, streaming our opening and
        closing ceremony via Twitch. There'll be a variety of virtual activities to give you a
