  StacsHack 7 is the latest incarnation of the annual hackathon hosted by the University of St Andrews Computing Society (STACS)!

  StacsHack will be a bit different this year being virtual, but we hope to still create that unique StacsHack atmosphere.

  There'll be prizes and lots of fun to be had, so we hope to see you there!
